Getting Started

You have been provided skeleton code to help you get started.

The current Makefile will automatically compile all .cpp and .h files present in the folder into an executable. The Makefile in the part_1 directory will create an executable called part_1. The Makefile in the part_2 directory will create an executable called part_2. The Makefile is already configured to include the pthread library.

To run your part_1 code:
In the terminal (Tools->Terminal), cd into the part_1 directory. Then run make to compile the program, make clean to delete the compiled files, and ./part_1 to run the executable.

To run your part_2 code:
In the terminal (Tools->Terminal), cd into the part_2 directory. Then run make to compile the program, make clean to delete the compiled files, and ./part_2 to run the executable.
